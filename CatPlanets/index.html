        <p> So here Cat, here is mercury. What are some facts about it? hmmm.... well let's see. It's named after the Roman messanger God Hermes, also the god of speed. 
          It's the smallest planet by far, it's also the closest planet to the sun, and since it's so small and close to the sun, it doesn't have a day-night cycle, 
          half is super hot and the other half is super dark, so there ya go, some Mercury facts.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"> <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FvuH9rqpggvw%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" style="width:800px;height:500px;"> </a>
        <p> So Venus huh? Ok well it's alot of things. It's named after the Roman Goddess Venus, who was the god of love and pleasure,
          and it reflects that by being super hot. It's called Earth's sister planet sometimes because of how similiar it is to Earth, 
          the only real difference being it's much closer to the sun so its atmosphere never had the capability to truly develop itself and block the heat of the sun. </p>

        <h3> Mercury </h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"> <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4047325.jpg" style="width:800px;height:500px;"> </a>
        <p> So here Cat, here is mercury. What are some facts about it? hmmm.... well let's see. It's named after the Roman messanger God Hermes, also the god of speed. 
          It's the smallest planet by far, it's also the closest planet to the sun, and since it's so small and close to the sun, it doesn't have a day-night cycle, 
          half is super hot and the other half is super dark, so there ya go, some Mercury facts.

        <h3> Venus </h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"> <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthumbs.dreamstime.com%2Fb%2Fsunrise-seen-space-venus-cinematic-very-realistic-66289259.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" style="width:800px;height:500px;"> </a>
        <p> So Venus huh? Ok well it's alot of things. It's named after the Roman Goddess Venus, who was the god of love and pleasure,
          and it reflects that by being super hot. It's called Earth's sister planet sometimes because of how similiar it is to Earth, 
          the only real difference being it's much closer to the sun so its atmosphere never had the capability to truly develop itself and block the heat of the sun. </p>

        <h3> Earth </h3> 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"> <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hdwallpaperslife.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F04%2Fearth_horizon_spacescape-wide.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" style="width:800px;height:500px;"> </a>
        <p> Our beautiful blue marble itself. This is where we live so I'm sure you don't need to learn much about it, but just in case, here's a few things. 
          It's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon. It is the only planet in our solar system known to be able to sustain life, well there's Europa and Triton but shhh...
          It's a continental planet that is mostly ocean, it's our beautiful home and I really like it here, those are your facts.

        <p> So here Cat, here is mercury. What are some facts about it? hmmm.... well let's see. It's named after the Roman messanger God Hermes, also the god of speed. 
          It's the smallest planet by far, it's also the closest planet to the sun, and since it's so small and close to the sun, it doesn't have a day-night cycle, half is super hot and the other half is super dark, so there ya go, some Mercury facts.
